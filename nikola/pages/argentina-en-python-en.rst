What is it?

*Argentina en Python* is a personal and communitary project that
promotes the usage of Python_ as a programming language to solve daily
issues for common users and also to develop powerful and complex
softwares in an easy way, encouraging the collaborative learning and
the Software Libre philosophy.

The method of the project to promote Python_ (among other personal
interests) is travelling around different cities, following the energy
of regional Software Libre communities and :doc:`getting in contact
<quien-escribe>` with people interested in a course or lecture about
these topics and also by simply sharing time together, talking about
other activities and getting in touch with different cultures and life
styles.

How it started?
---------------

The true history is long, complex, confusing, fragil and with some
changes in the direction of it. Now, the project itself is different
to the original idea that was born like an imposible dream. Although,
the project that I am working on right now is similar to the `last
proposal`_ we worked on. It consists in deliver lectures, courses and
workshops for free while traveling around the whole country (and
neighbours).

 .. _last proposal: argentina-en-python__proyecto_original.pdf

:doc:`There are some reasons <experimentando-la-busqueda>` that
stopped this proposal to be realized as it was, so I had to change
some things and re-adapt others. There are a lot of lectures that are
being delivered in an informal way while talking to people that do not
know the concept of Software Libre and programming languages
(e.g. like people staying in hostels). Sometimes I helped people with
simple Python_ scripts to solve daily issues and with GNU/Linux
concepts to start with Python_.


The vehicle
-----------

I'm traveling in my own car with some modifications to be able to put
a small bed in it so I can sleep inside the car when it's necessary. I
also travel with a basic set of kitchen equipment to be able to stay
in campings in different places.

I try to organize myself to stay with local people in their houses and
share moments, typical places, talks and experiences. This is the best
part!


In which stage are we?
----------------------

Stage 0
*******

As a good developer, the trip has to start with a "Stage 0". I hit the
road on February 21st to Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires as my first
destiny to start the preparation of this *amazing (unknown) project*.

This stage was a personal experiment to know if it was possible, to
organize myself to be able to work as a Python_ developer and travel at
the same time by trying different ways.

Itinerary:

* Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina
* Martínez, Buenos Aires, Argentina
* San Clemente del Tuyú, Buenos Aires, Argentina
* Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina
* Quilmes, Buenos Aires, Argentina
* Tigre, Buenos Aires, Argentina
* Olivos, Buenos Aires, Argentina
* González Catán, Buenos Aires, Argentina
* Martínez, Buenos Aires, Argentina
* Paraná, Entre Ríos, Argentina

First Stage
************

I left Paraná, Entre Ríos on March 16th to go to Córdoba Capital because
I had some contacts to start moving something there. I started talking
to the people when I arrived and I met a lot of people and places
because the contacts they gave me and people they presented to me.

*On July 26th I went back to Paraná to take some personal decisions and
also about the project itself. I started planning the posibility of a
second stage with Santiago del Estero as a first destiny.*

The places I stayed in this stage:

* Córdoba, Córdoba, Argentina
* Capilla del Monte, Córdoba, Argentina (`photos

The idea of the second stage started on Friday 5th, September starting
from Paraná to Rafaela as first stop:

I visited these cities in the second stage:

Third Stage
***********

The last stage was very intense and also the
:doc:`python-conference-argentina-2014`. During those almost three
months of traveling, many things happened, changed and some projects
were created.

There was a re-structure in the way I've been traveling, I shared some
time traveling with people that I met in the trip and I learnt
different ways of traveling that helped me to improve mine. Now, in
this stage, I'm traveling with Johanna (a girl that I met in a course)
who is helping me with the organization of many things. Our idea is to
go North-East (Corrientes, Chaco, Misiones, etc) and visit other
countries like Paraguay and Bolivia, for example.

You can check :doc:`the map <argentina-en-python/donde-esta-humitos>`
to see which are the next cities we are going to visit so we can start
organizing talks and course with more time.

For this stage, we hit the road on Monday 8th, December and these are
the places we have visited:

* Concordia, Entre Ríos, Argentina
* Salto, Salto, Uruguay
* Chajarí, Entre Ríos, Argentina
* Mercedes, Corrientes, Argentina
* Bella Vista, Corrientes, Argentina
* Corrientes, Corrientes, Argentina
* Las Breñas, Chaco, Argentina
* Mburucuyá, Corrientes, Argentina
* San Miguel, Corrientes, Argentina
* Nuestra Señora de Caá Catí, Corrientes, Argentina
* Formosa, Formosa, Argentina
* Laguna Naineck, Formosa, Argentina
* Asunción, Paraguay

When does it finish?
--------------------

At the moment, there is no closing date of this Third Stage. We
suppose we are going to get in touch with people we met at
PyConAr2014_ from Paraguay and Brazil when we arrived at Misiones, so
we can share Python and Software Libre in other countries also.

.. _PyConAr2014: http://myconference.co/pyconar2014


How I can colaborate?
---------------------

It's really important to me :doc:`make contacts <mendoza-tiene-agite>`
with people interested in these topics so we can coordinate some
activities to do: from circus to programming, among photography and
cultural events.

This allow us a better organization on delivering talks and workshops
that take more time to make it and also to spread the word. Simply,
it's easier, safe and exciting to go to a place where I already have a
contact to someone to share my staying in that place without the
needing of hosting me. That's an extra point.

Also, if you want to support the project in an economic way, you can
visit the :doc:`donation page <argentina-en-python/donaciones>` to
see how to do it and help me to keep moving the wheel.

A lot of people helped me to be here right now: thanks to them. I
think I already told them about this but if not, I hope they are
reading this :)
