00:00:12,691 --> 00:00:14,191
Please say something

2
00:00:31,446 --> 00:00:32,946
Hello Love

3
00:00:33,993 --> 00:00:35,493
Get out of the fucking way

4
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,480
Oh God. Please darling...

5
00:00:39,423 --> 00:00:40,923
No...

6
00:00:45,401 --> 00:00:46,901
Dear?!?

7
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,450
Oh my God, who did this?

8
00:00:48,834 --> 00:00:50,334
I'll call a doctor

9
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:51,219
No doctors! I'm fine, really

10
00:01:01,237 --> 00:01:02,737
I made you some coffee

11
00:01:10,734 --> 00:01:12,234
Hey!

12
00:01:28,001 --> 00:01:29,501
Dear?

13
00:01:29,257 --> 00:01:30,757
Yes?!

14
00:01:30,105 --> 00:01:31,605
Your scarf looks good

15
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:32,729
Oh...!

16
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:48,373
FUCK

17
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,150
Dear! How do you feel?

18
00:02:28,661 --> 00:02:30,161
I lost the scarf...

19
00:02:30,474 --> 00:02:31,974
Doesn't matter,
we'll buy you another...

20
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,690
Are you mad at me?

21
00:02:33,396 --> 00:02:34,896
No! Of course not...

22
00:02:34,412 --> 00:02:35,912
I'm so happy you're better

23
00:02:36,425 --> 00:02:37,925
Let's go home so we
can talk everything over

24
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:45,931
She said she was
going to leave him...

25
00:02:51,716 --> 00:02:53,216
Let's have dinner, then we can...

26
00:02:53,232 --> 00:02:54,732
No... I have some work to do

27
00:02:57,335 --> 00:02:58,835
AND LATER

28
00:03:02,632 --> 00:03:04,132
Ahhh!

29
00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:12,079
Will you SHUT UP in there?

30
00:03:16,316 --> 00:03:17,816
I'm leaving... I've had enough

31
00:03:30,024 --> 00:03:31,524
50 YEARS LATER

32
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,210
You still think about him, don't you?

33
00:03:45,782 --> 00:03:47,482
FINISHED!

34
00:03:50,825 --> 00:03:52,325
Fuck

35
00:03:53,388 --> 00:03:54,888
The remote...

36
00:03:54,448 --> 00:03:55,948
Where's the fucking remote control?

37
00:04:01,302 --> 00:04:02,802
I'm leaving. I've had enough

38
00:04:02,421 --> 00:04:03,921
No please, wait

39
00:04:06,215 --> 00:04:07,715
I want to talk... I'm so sorry

40
00:04:10,258 --> 00:04:11,758
We need to leave the city for a while

41
00:04:24,921 --> 00:04:26,421
Some day...

42
00:04:26,136 --> 00:04:27,636
Some day I will figure this out

43
00:04:59,327 --> 00:05:00,827
Give me that!

44
00:05:00,438 --> 00:05:01,938
Hey!

45
00:06:04,454 --> 00:06:05,954
Do you think it will always be like this?

46
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:23,983
No

47
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:25,317
I just want to hear the radio

48
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:26,631
I said No!

49
00:06:44,191 --> 00:06:45,691
7 WEEKS LATER

50
00:06:55,074 --> 00:06:56,574
She needs more time

51
00:06:57,085 --> 00:06:58,585
You should go home and rest

52
00:07:01,515 --> 00:07:03,015
Building 2106 please

53
00:07:04,537 --> 00:07:06,037
Mind if I put on the radio?

54
00:07:06,955 --> 00:07:08,455
... No

55
00:07:16,414 --> 00:07:17,914
Hey you're that writer aren't you?

56
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,130
Sorry, must be someone else...

57
00:07:34,739 --> 00:07:36,239
I can explain!

58
00:08:05,142 --> 00:08:06,642
Ok... and how long will that take?

59
00:08:31,102 --> 00:08:32,602
She's gone

60
00:09:53,815 --> 00:09:55,315
THE END
