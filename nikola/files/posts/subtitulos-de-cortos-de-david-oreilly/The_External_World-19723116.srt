00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:39,212
Do it again

3
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,495
No. Do it again

4
00:00:57,709 --> 00:00:58,709
Do it again!

Tantric suicide

8
00:02:20,339 --> 00:02:21,839
Meanwhile

9
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:00,915
I want to start you on a treatment that I think it's right for you

10
00:03:05,086 --> 00:03:06,086
Go fuck yourself

11
00:03:07,793 --> 00:03:11,183
OK. Come back to me if you're having anymore problems

12
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:15,131
Applause

13
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:16,865
Hello everybody

14
00:03:17,134 --> 00:03:18,928
You are not my real father

15
00:03:21,085 --> 00:03:22,085
Something smells delicious

16
00:03:22,185 --> 00:03:23,842
Why don't you join us? We're having roast beaf

17
00:03:24,764 --> 00:03:25,764
OK. Don't see why not

18
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,482
I hate myself and everybody around me

19
00:03:30,073 --> 00:03:31,201
Can I get you something to drink?

20
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:33,571
No need. I got tanked before I came down down here*

21
00:03:34,371 --> 00:03:36,271
We're all there alone and unloved

22
00:03:38,692 --> 00:03:40,724
Later

23
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:56,533
Stand back

24
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:01,683
Pappa!

25
00:04:15,773 --> 00:04:17,273
Pharmacy

26
00:04:18,232 --> 00:04:20,005
Just a second

27
00:04:22,202 --> 00:04:24,031
Here you go. Have a nice day Sr

28
00:04:26,697 --> 00:04:28,982
Go fuck yourself

The external world

30
00:04:46,675 --> 00:04:47,561
Let's have tea!

31
00:05:13,969 --> 00:05:14,969
Then

32
00:05:20,748 --> 00:05:22,771
Please. I need to get to the hospital

33
00:05:22,971 --> 00:05:25,919
Beat it, kid. I don't drive your kind

34
00:06:49,369 --> 00:06:50,769
Typical

35
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,640
No

36
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,214
Wrong. Do it again

37
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:42,563
Moments earlier

38
00:08:04,325 --> 00:08:05,487

Intermission

40
00:08:18,934 --> 00:08:20,657
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the intermission

41
00:08:20,872 --> 00:08:24,103
This is a good time to collect our thoughts and reflect about what we've seen so far

42
00:08:25,377 --> 00:08:27,249
I personally was nearly brought to tears but...

43
00:08:29,846 --> 00:08:33,205
and I'll never forget the look on Hobbie Wine's tinned face when he opened the box...

44
00:08:36,202 --> 00:08:39,348
and I found out the hard way that even turtles have vaginas so...

45
00:08:49,687 --> 00:08:50,735
No flash photography

46
00:09:22,885 --> 00:09:24,085
Typical

47
00:09:25,995 --> 00:09:27,144
Isn't this about influence?

48
00:09:27,406 --> 00:09:30,815
Don't worry. It is just animation.
It has no real effect on people

49
00:09:32,276 --> 00:09:34,411
Else where

50
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,313
The cat

51
00:09:52,478 --> 00:09:52,978
The external world

52
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,818
So how old are you anyway?

53
00:10:00,818 --> 00:10:01,997
4 and a half

54
00:10:04,123 --> 00:10:05,238
Wait, so this is illegal?

55
00:10:05,635 --> 00:10:06,635
No! I'm 89 in human years

56
00:10:09,361 --> 00:10:10,819
You're as tight as an 85 year old

57
00:10:11,171 --> 00:10:14,071
I can't feel my face!

58
00:10:29,324 --> 00:10:30,324
NO!

59
00:10:30,424 --> 00:10:32,095
DO IT AGAIN!

60
00:10:39,685 --> 00:10:41,460
NO! DO IT AGAIN!

61
00:11:06,631 --> 00:11:07,779
Tear

62
00:11:08,129 --> 00:11:09,129
Sorry

63
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,179
I'm sorry

64
00:11:18,442 --> 00:11:19,442
Puddle

65
00:11:31,203 --> 00:11:32,889
Hey! Excuse me

66
00:11:33,713 --> 00:11:35,960
Excuse me

67
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,069
One second. Would you mind opening your jacket?

68
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:46,037
UNACCEPTABLE

69
00:11:46,137 --> 00:11:49,820
BEHAVIOUR

70
00:11:55,476 --> 00:11:56,899

Freedom

72
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,586

Nothing is Wrong Hospital

76
00:12:59,341 --> 00:13:02,041
Dad, why are you here? There is nothing wrong with you

77
00:13:04,765 --> 00:13:07,565
Please do not remind patients that nothing is wrong with them

The external world

79
00:13:11,942 --> 00:13:13,642
This sure is delicious!

80
00:13:14,254 --> 00:13:15,854
You bet!

81
00:13:21,448 --> 00:13:23,348
Don't cry, we can make more!

82
00:13:29,897 --> 00:13:33,197
Due to budgetary constraints we could not afford
to render the following scene in 3D

83
00:13:33,803 --> 00:13:37,063
Instead we have replaced it with some early
animation tests to fill up space

84
00:13:44,013 --> 00:13:45,113
Fourteen!

85
00:13:45,363 --> 00:13:47,663
Surrender or release the lesbians!

86
00:13:51,042 --> 00:13:53,732
For your consideration

87
00:13:54,213 --> 00:13:55,913
I can see my brains!

Previously on
The External World

89
00:14:10,548 --> 00:14:11,748
Sorry

90
00:14:24,636 --> 00:14:27,028
So, anyway. You kids should really get to bed

91
00:14:27,397 --> 00:14:30,221
Me and your mother have some business to take care of

92
00:14:30,473 --> 00:14:32,073
Hey! Not in front of the kids

93
00:14:31,986 --> 00:14:33,786
Exactly

94
00:14:37,427 --> 00:14:39,227
Exactly

95
00:14:57,972 --> 00:15:00,172
Remember: this is merely a cartoon.
None of this is real.

96
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:03,090
This is a purely fictional occurrence,
in no way based on reality.

97
00:15:04,609 --> 00:15:07,509
This is not happening in this universe
or any other

98
00:15:07,644 --> 00:15:09,844
Neither are these words.
Neither are you

99
00:15:10,094 --> 00:15:12,594
There is only a silent emptiness
spreading infinitely in all directions.

100
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:40,555
The end
