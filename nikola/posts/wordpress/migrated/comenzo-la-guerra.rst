    The war has started!

    This is a Linux game called GNUJump and it's very fun. I'm uploading
    my highscore and the point is, if you can mark a better highscore,
    record a new video (I used gtk-recordmydesktop) and respond it.

    We are going to know who is the best!

    You can download the game from here: \*

    PS: this is my second time that I play the game, I hope to improve
    my highscore in the next one ;)
