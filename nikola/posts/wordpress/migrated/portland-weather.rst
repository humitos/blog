I was told that in Portland it rains a lot. I didn't believe it when I
came here because most of the days were sunny and not so cold.
Yesterday, it rained and it was the second time that it rained since I'm
here. I mean, the rain here is not the same rain than in Paraná; for me
was just ... no storm, no wind, no nothing... Just a little drizzle.
That's the way that it rains here, so you can keep doing your normal
things even when it's raining.
