</p><blockquote>The war has started!

<p>This is a Linux game called GNUJump and it's very fun. I'm uploading my highscore and the point is, if you can mark a better highscore, record a new video (I used gtk-recordmydesktop) and respond it.</p>

<p>We are going to know who is the best!</p>

<p>You can download the game from here:

<p>PS: this is my second time that I play the game, I hope to improve my highscore in the next one ;)</p></blockquote></body></html>
