<p>I was told that in Portland it rains a lot. I didn't believe it when I came here because most of the days were sunny and not so cold. Yesterday, it rained and it was the second time that it rained since I'm here. I mean, the rain here is not the same rain than in Paraná; for me was just ... no storm, no wind, no nothing... Just a little drizzle. That's the way that it rains here, so you can keep doing your normal things even when it's raining.</p>
